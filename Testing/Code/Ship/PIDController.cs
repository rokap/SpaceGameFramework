/// <summary>
/// An implementation of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller. PID controllers are used
/// to provide continually modulated input as a feedback of its error value upon which a correction
/// is applied. In other words, to have a physics-controlled spaceship, you need a PID controller
/// to make it turn towards the destination correctly. This class is used directly by the SteerAction.
/// 
/// How the ships handle will depends, in part, on these parameters (P, I and D). Tweaking these 
/// parameters will help you understand how it affects steering.
